"Psychological peace" (such as a peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing
 "behavioral peace."  Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition."  Some have expressed the belief that peace can be
 initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its
 existence.The acquisition of such a "peaceful internal disposition" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving of otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests.
 Another internationally important approach to peace is the international, national and local protection of cultural assets in the event of conflicts.
 [[United Nations]], [[UNESCO]] and [[Blue Shield International]] deal with the protection of cultural heritage. This also applies to the integration of
 [[United Nations peacekeeping]]. UNESCO Director General [[Irina Bokova]] stated: "The protection of culture and heritage is a humanitarian and security
 policy imperative that also paves the way for resilience, reconciliation and peace." The protection of the cultural heritage should preserve the particularly
 sensitive cultural memory, the growing cultural diversity and the economic basis of a state, a municipality or a region. In many conflicts there is a
 deliberate attempt to destroy the opponent's cultural heritage. Whereby there is also a connection between cultural user disruption or cultural heritage
 and the cause of flight. But protection can only be implemented in a sustainable manner through the fundamental cooperation and training of military units
 and civilian personnel, together with the locals.
