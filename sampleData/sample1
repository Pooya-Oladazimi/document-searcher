'''War''' is an intense armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]], [[government]]s, [[Society|societies]], or [[paramilitary]] groups such as [[mercenaries]], [[insurgent]]s and [[militia]]s. It is generally characterized by extreme [[violence]], [[aggression]], destruction, and mortality, using [[Regular army|regular]] or [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[military forces]]. '''Warfare''' refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.<ref>{{cite web|title=Warfare|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/warfare|website=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref> [[Total war]] is warfare that is not restricted to purely [[legitimate military target]]s, and can result in massive [[civilian casualties|civilian]] or other [[non-combatant]] suffering and [[Casualty (person)|casualties]].

The [[war studies|scholarly study of war]] is sometimes called polemology ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} {{Respell|POL|ə|MOL|ə|jee}}), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''polemos'', meaning "war", and ''[[-logy]]'', meaning "the study of".

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]]]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the 11th-century [[Old English]] words ''wyrre'' and ''werre'', from [[Old French]] ''werre'' (also ''guerre'' as in modern French), in turn from the [[Franks|Frankish]] *''werra'', ultimately deriving from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''werzō'' 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'', meaning “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=war |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref>

==Types of warfare==
<!-- include "warfare" to denote focus on methods of conducting wars, excluding their causes -->
{{Main|Outline of war#Types of war|l1=Types of war}}

* [[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between [[belligerent]]s of drastically different levels of military capability or size.
* [[Biological warfare]], or germ warfare, is the use of weaponized biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
* [[Chemical warfare]] involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians.<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=August 24, 2007 |pages=567–70 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-8493-1434-6}}</ref>
* [[Cold warfare]] is an intense international rivalry without direct military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high levels of military preparations, expenditures, and development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as [[economic warfare]], [[political warfare]], [[covert operation]]s, [[espionage]], [[cyberwarfare]], or [[proxy war]]s.
* [[Conventional warfare]] is declared war between states in which [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[biological weapon|biological]], or [[chemical weapons]] are not used or see limited deployment.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems.
* [[Insurgency]] is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful combatants). An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare, and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
* [[Information warfare]] is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the [[computer]]s and [[Computer network|networks]] that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |title=Information Warfare |last=Lewis |first=Brian C. |date= |website=Federation of American Scientist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617035106/http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |archive-date=17 June 1997 |url-status=dead |access-date=27 Feb 2017 |df= }}</ref>
* [[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
* [[Total war]] is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the [[laws of war]], placing no limits on [[legitimate military target]]s, using [[weapon]]s and [[Military tactics|tactics]] resulting in significant [[civilian casualties]], or demanding a [[war effort]] requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population.
* [[Unconventional warfare]], the opposite of conventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.

[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, archeologist)]]
The earliest evidence of [[prehistoric warfare]] is a [[Mesolithic]] cemetery in [[Jebel Sahaba]], which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death.<ref name="Keeley page 37">Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 37.</ref> Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,<ref>Diamond, Jared, ''Guns, Germs and Steel''</ref> military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, "One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20)."<ref>{{cite book|author=Conway W.

The lower figure is more plausible,<ref>Roberto Muehlenkamp, [http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/germs-vs-guns-or-death-from-mass.html 'Germs vs. guns, or death from mass violence in perspective']</ref> but could also be on the high side, considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 BC and 2002 AD (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total.<ref>Matthew White, ''Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements'', Canongate Books Ltd.

For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century.<ref>David McCandless, [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/20th-century-death '20th Century Death']</ref> [[Nuclear warfare]] breaking out in August 1988, when nuclear arsenals were at peak level, and the aftermath thereof, could have reduced human population from 5,150,000,000 by 1,850,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 within a period of about one year, according to a projection that did not consider "the most severe predictions concerning [[nuclear winter]]".<ref>Wm.

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121021158/http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and many fought constantly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref>

Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.<ref>Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez, eds. 2012. ''The Bioarchaeology of Violence''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTI002</ref> Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.<ref name="Keeley page 55">Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 55.</ref>

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans].'"<ref>{{cite book|author=W.

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."<ref name="EinsteinWWIV">{{cite web|year=1947 |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |title=Albert Einstein: Man of Imagination |accessdate=2010-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604080636/http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |archivedate=4 June 2010 }} Nuclear Age Peace Foundation paper

A distinctive feature since 1945 is the absence of wars between major powers—indeed the near absence of any traditional wars between established countries. The major exceptions were the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the  [[Iran–Iraq War]] 1980–1988, and the [[Gulf War]] of 1990–91.  Instead actual fighting has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies.<ref>Robert J.

The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.<ref>Hewitt, Joseph, J.

Throughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as [[World War I]], although it was higher during [[World War II]] (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/|title=War and Peace|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref>

The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is [[World War II]], from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85&nbsp;million deaths, followed by the [[Mongol conquests]]<ref>*The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, 1994, p. 622, cited by White

Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples.

===On civilians===
{{see also|Civilian casualties}}
[[File:The Hanging by Jacques Callot.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]'' depict the destruction unleashed on civilians during the [[Thirty Years' War]].]]
Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to [[famine]], disease, and death in the [[civilian]] [[population]]). During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was reduced by 15 to 40 percent.<ref>[http://necrometrics.com/pre1700a.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618–48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics]. Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref> Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war.

Most estimates of [[World War II casualties]] indicate around 60&nbsp;million people died, 40&nbsp;million of which were civilians.<ref>{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> Deaths in the [[Soviet Union]] were around [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|27 million]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead | date=9 May 2005 | accessdate=6 January 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref> Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.<ref>{{cite book|first=Geoffrey A. |last=Hosking|title=Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&pg=PA242|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|pages=242–}}</ref>

===Economic===
{{see also|Military Keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists{{who|date=July 2016}} believe war can stimulate a country's economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the U.S. out of the [[Great Depression]] by most [[Keynesian]] economists), but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gatrell|first1=Peter|title=Russia's First World War : A Social and Economic History|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781317881391|page=270}}</ref>

===Artistic===
War leads to [[forced migration]] causing potentially large displacements of population. Among forced migrants there are usually relatively large shares of artists and other types of creative people, causing so the war effects to be particularly harmful for the country's creative potential in the long-run.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jan Borowiecki | first1 = Karol | year = 2012 | title = Are composers different?

In war, cultural institutions, such as libraries, can become "targets in themselves; their elimination was a way to denigrate and demoralize the enemy population." The impact such destruction can have on a society is important because "in an era in which competing ideologies fuel internal and international conflict, the destruction of libraries and other items of cultural significance is neither random nor irrelevant. Preserving the world’s repositories of knowledge is crucial to ensuring that the darkest moments of history do not endlessly repeat themselves."<ref>Glenn, K. (2007).

Tangible/intangible aims:
* Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of [[Lebensraum]] in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]).
* Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation<ref>

===Psychoanalytic===
Dutch [[psychoanalyst]] [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction."<ref name = "meerloo">

</ref>

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.<ref>Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.</ref> This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[race (human classification)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.<ref>(Fornari 1975)</ref> Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.<ref>Blanning, T.C.W. "The Origin of Great Wars." ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' p. 5</ref> Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.<ref>Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.</ref> He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and [[competition]] over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.<ref>Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag</ref>

The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s,<ref name = "ApesWar">{{cite news

Psychologist and linguist [[Steven Pinker]] argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steven Pinker |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}  He also argued that in order to have credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation ("[[honor]]").{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors".<ref name="HumanPrimateAggression">''Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals'' By Peter M. Kappeler, Joan B. Silk, 2009, Chapter 8, "Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans; The Case for a Unified Theory", Margaret C. Crofoot and Richard W. Wrangham</ref>

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.<ref>Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)</ref> Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the [[Chewong]] and [[Semai people|Semai]] of the Malay peninsula.<ref>Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) ''Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives''. London: Routledge</ref> Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.<ref>[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/eugene.burnstein/files/35._low_93_evolutionaryperspective_war.pdf "An Evolutionary Perspective on War"], Bobbi S.

War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. War has also been linked to [[economic development]] by economic historians and development economists studying [[state-building]] and [[fiscal capacity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=2015|title=States and Economic Growth: Capacity and Constraints|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/md0bpim4r69d5eq/State%20Capacity%20Survey%2010-5-15%20Draft.pdf?dl=0|journal=George Mason University WORKING PAPER|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.<ref>[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.</ref><ref>Hawkins, Mike.

===Marxist===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxemburg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref>

===Demographic===
<!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] -->

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:

====Malthusian====
[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Mogadishu residential area.JPEG|thumb|right|U.S. Marine helicopter on patrol in Somalia as part of the [[Unified Task Force]], 1992]]
[[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian theories]] see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], advocating Crusade as a solution to European overpopulation, said:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}</ref>}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}</ref>

The violent [[herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria]], [[Mali]], [[Sudanese nomadic conflicts|Sudan]] and other countries in the [[Sahel]] region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth.<ref>{{cite news |title=In Mali, waning fortunes of Fulani herders play into Islamist hands |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mali-fulani/in-mali-waning-fortunes-of-fulani-herders-play-into-islamist-hands-idUSKBN13F0L2 |agency=Reuters |date=20 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How Climate Change Is Spurring Land Conflict in Nigeria |url=http://time.com/5324712/climate-change-nigeria/ |work=Time |date=28 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Deadliest Conflict You've Never Heard of |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/nigeria/2019-01-23/deadliest-conflict-youve-never-heard |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=23 January 2019}}</ref>

====Youth bulge====
[[File:2017 world map, median age by country.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. War reduces life expectancy. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent in some countries in West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.]]

According to [[Gunnar Heinsohn|Heinsohn]], who proposed [[youth bulge]] theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.<ref>Helgerson, John L.

(2006): "Demography and War" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310263543/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Demography-and-War (online)]</ref>

Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.<ref>Heinsohn, G.

===Rationalist===
[[File:LRPs directing artillery.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. soldiers directing artillery on enemy trucks in A Shau Valley, April 1968]]
[[Rationalism (international relations)|Rationalism]] is an [[international relations theory]] or framework. Rationalism (and [[Neorealism (international relations)]]) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Rationalist Explanations for War|last = Fearon|first = James D.|date = Summer 1995|journal = International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379–414|doi = 10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid = |jstor=2706903}}</ref>  Under one [[game theory]] approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the [[peace war game]], optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played. In "Rationalist Explanations for War", [[James Fearon]] examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
* Issue indivisibilities
* Incentives to misrepresent or [[information asymmetry]]
* Commitment problems<ref name=":0" />

"Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.

[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
"[[Information asymmetry]] with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power."<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Blainey|title=Causes of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mcknp3tt0LMC&pg=PA114|year=1988|edition=3rd|page=114|accessdate=2016-03-19|isbn=9780029035917}}</ref> Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = Robert | year = 2002 | title = Bargaining Theory and International Conflict | url = | journal = Annual Review of Political Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–30 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.092601.141138 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of [[cognitive bias]],<ref>Chris Cramer, 'Civil War is Not a Stupid Thing', {{ISBN|978-1850658214}}</ref> but are still "as rational as you and me".<ref>From point 10 of [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think (article)], accessed 16 December 2014.</ref>  According to philosopher [[Iain King]], "Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury...."<ref>Quote from [[Iain King]], in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]</ref>  King asserts that "Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in [[GroupThink]]" which is faulty, but still rational.<ref>Point 6 in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]</ref>

The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lake|first1=David A.|title=Two Cheers for Bargaining Theory: Assessing Rationalist Explanations of the Iraq War|journal=International Security|date=November 2010|pages=7–52|doi=10.1162/isec_a_00029|volume=35|issue=3}}</ref>

===Political science===
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the [[Correlates of War]] Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in ''[[Man, the State, and War]]'' and has been often used by political scientists since then.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|143}}

====System-level====

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the [[security dilemma]].<ref name=Levy1998>{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=The Causes of War and the Conditions of Peace|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=Jun 1998|volume=1|pages=139–65|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.139|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{rp|145}}

Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]], and the [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] school represented by scholars such as [[Kenneth Waltz]] and [[John Mearsheimer]], two main sub-theories are:
# [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing."<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|147}} However, evidence has shown power [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]] is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|147–48}}
# [[Power transition theory]]: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|148}} On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become ''more'' probable when power is more equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has empirical support.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|148}}
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|148}}

[[Liberalism (international relations)|Liberalism]] as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations.  Realists{{who|date=July 2016}} respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|149}} Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|150}} Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|150}}

====Societal-level====
* [[Diversionary foreign policy|Diversionary theory]], also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|152}} This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility [[Realistic conflict theory|enhances]] in-group [[Group cohesiveness|bonding]], and a significant domestic "rally effect" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|152–13}} However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|152–53}} U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.<ref name="MilitaryAdventurism">{{cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| title = Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy (p. 19)| accessdate = 2010-02-07| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224412/http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| archivedate = 7 July 2011| df = dmy-all}} More recently studies (Lebow 2008, Lindemann 2010) demonstrated that striving for self-esteem (i.e. virile self images), and recognition as a Great Power or non-recognition (exclusion and punishment of great powers, denying traumatic historical events) is a principal cause of international conflict and war.
</ref>

====Individual-level====

These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|157}} For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by [[bounded rationality]] and various [[cognitive biases]],<ref name=Levy1998 />{{rp|157}} such as [[prospect theory]].<ref name=Levy1997>{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=Prospect Theory, Rational Choice, and International Relations|journal=International Studies Quarterly|date=Mar 1997|volume=41|issue=1|pages=87–112|url=http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00034|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075824/http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The [[morality]] of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.<ref name="DeForrest">{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=Conclusion |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/ |website=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ |publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law |accessdate=August 1, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402204812/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26 |archivedate=2 April 2010 }}</ref>

The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the [[just war theory]], are ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' and ''[[Jus in bello]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY |url= }}</ref>

''Jus ad bellum'' (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.<ref>{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020212080058/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2002|website=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref>

''[[Jus in bello]]'' (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.<ref name="Moseley">{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref> The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.<ref name="Moseley"/> Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.<ref name="Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304">{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-09067-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/war00paul/page/304 304]|url=https://archive.org/details/war00paul/page/304}}</ref>

Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as [[Pragmatism]], racism, and [[social Darwinism]], hold that violence is good.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin and Feldman, eds|first=Roger and Matthew|title=Fascism: Fascism and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=185}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Woodley|first=Daniel|title=Fascism and political theory critical perspectives on fascist ideology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-87157-7|page=276|url=http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112104606/http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-01-12}}</ref> Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]]. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.<ref>Ankony, Robert C., "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012.</ref>
