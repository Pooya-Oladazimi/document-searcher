The United States detonated two [[nuclear weapons]] over the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.

In the final year of [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prepared for a costly [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. This undertaking was preceded by a [[Air raids on Japan|conventional and firebombing campaign]] that devastated 67 Japanese cities. The [[European theatre of World War II|war in Europe]] concluded when Germany [[German Instrument of Surrender|surrendered]] on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the [[Pacific War]]. By July 1945, the Allies' [[Manhattan Project]] had produced two types of atomic bombs: "[[Fat Man]]", a [[plutonium]] [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]; and "[[Little Boy]]", an [[enriched uranium]] [[gun-type fission weapon]]. The [[509th Composite Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]]  was trained and equipped with  the specialized [[Silverplate]] version of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], and deployed to [[Tinian]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the [[Imperial Japanese armed forces]] in the [[Potsdam Declaration]] on July 26, 1945, the alternative being "prompt and utter destruction". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.

The consent of the United Kingdom was obtained for the bombing, as was required by the [[Quebec Agreement]], and orders were issued for atomic bombs to be used against Hiroshima, [[Kokura]], [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]] and Nagasaki on July 25. On August 6, the B-29 ''[[Enola Gay]]'' dropped a Little Boy on Hiroshima, an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters. Three days later, to take advantage of favorable weather, the B-29 ''[[Bockscar]]'' dropped a Fat Man on Nagasaki, a major military port, one of Japan's largest shipbuilding and repair centers, and an important producer of naval ordnance. Over the next two to four months, the [[Effects of nuclear explosions|effects of the atomic bombing]]s killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half occurred on the first day. For months afterward, large numbers of people continued to die from the effects of burns, [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]], and injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. Most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.

[[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] to the Allies on August 15, six days after the [[Soviet–Japanese War|Soviet Union's declaration of war]] and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|instrument of surrender]] on September 2, effectively [[End of World War II in Asia|ending the war]]. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in popular culture|popular culture]], and there is still [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|much debate]] concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.

==Background==
===Pacific War===
{{Main|Pacific War}}
[[File:1945-08-01JapWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Situation of the Pacific War on August 1, 1945. Areas still controlled by Japan (in white and green) included Korea, Taiwan, [[Indochina]], and much of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], including most of the main cities, and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Allied-held areas are in red, with the neutral Soviet Union and Mongolia in grey.|alt=A map of East Asia and the Western Pacific during World War II]]
In 1945, the [[Pacific War]] between the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] entered its fourth year. Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25&nbsp;million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in [[World War II]] included both [[military personnel]] [[killed in action]] and [[wounded in action]]. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German [[Ardennes Offensive]]. America's reserves of manpower were running out. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2–3, 49–51}}

In the Pacific, the Allies [[Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)|returned to the Philippines]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=307}} [[Burma Campaign 1944–1945|recaptured Burma]],{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=532}} and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invaded Borneo]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=527}} Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], [[Aitape–Wewak campaign|New Guinea]] and the Philippines.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=48–49}} In April 1945, American forces [[Battle of Okinawa|landed on Okinawa]], where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from five to one in the Philippines to two to one on Okinawa.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=2–3, 49–51}} Although some Japanese soldiers were [[Japanese prisoners of war in World War II|taken prisoner]], most fought until they were killed or committed [[suicide]]. Nearly 99 percent of the 21,000 defenders of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] were killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] in April to June 1945, 94 percent were killed;{{sfn|Brooks|Stanley|2007|pp=41–44}} 7,401 Japanese soldiers surrendered, an unprecedentedly large number.{{sfn|Appleman|Burns|Gugeler|Stevens|1948|pp=462–467}}

As the Allies advanced towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 [[Gross register tonnage|gross tons]] in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22 percent of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]] advised [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.{{sfn|Coox|1969|pp=2540–2544}}

===Preparations to invade Japan===
{{Main|Operation Downfall}}
Even before the [[Victory in Europe Day|surrender of Nazi Germany]] on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, [[Operation Downfall]], the Allied invasion of Japan.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=32–34}} The operation had two parts: [[Operation Downfall#Olympic|Operation Olympic]] and [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]]. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]].{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=125–130}} Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the [[Kantō Plain]], near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of [[Honshu|Honshū]] by the U.S. [[First United States Army|First]], [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth]] and [[Tenth United States Army|Tenth]] Armies, as well as a [[Commonwealth Corps]] made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the [[Climate of Japan|Japanese winter]] to pass.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=169–171}}

[[File:"Jap...You're Next^ We'll Finish the Job" - NARA - 513563.jpg|thumb|left|upright|U.S. Army propaganda poster depicting [[Uncle Sam]] preparing the public for the invasion of Japan after ending war on Germany and Italy|alt=Uncle Sam holding a spanner, rolling up his sleeves]]
[[Geography of Japan|Japan's geography]] made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, [[Operation Ketsugō]], accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=45–48}} Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]] in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan,{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=21}} and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defense, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=70–72}} In all, there were 2.3&nbsp;million [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] troops prepared to defend the home islands, backed by a [[Volunteer Fighting Corps|civilian militia]] of 28&nbsp;million men and women. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takijirō Ōnishi]], predicted up to 20&nbsp;million Japanese deaths.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=121–124}}

On June 15, 1945, a study by the Joint War Plans Committee,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Final Months of the War With Japan. Part III (note 24) |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-final-months-of-the-war-with-japan-signals-intelligence-u-s-invasion-planning-and-the-a-bomb-decision/csi9810001.html#rtoc7 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> who provided planning information to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], estimated that Olympic would result in 130,000 to 220,000 U.S. casualties, with U.S. dead in the range from 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[George Marshall]], and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]], signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|p=48}}

The Americans were alarmed by the Japanese buildup, which was accurately tracked through [[Ultra]] intelligence.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=202–225}} [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by [[Quincy Wright]] and [[William Shockley]]. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels [[James McCormack]] and [[Dean Rusk]], and examined casualty forecasts by [[Michael E. DeBakey]] and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4&nbsp;million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=98–99}}{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=340}}

Marshall began contemplating the use of a weapon that was "readily available and which assuredly can decrease the cost in American lives":{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=112}} [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]]. Quantities of [[phosgene]], [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], [[tear gas]] and [[cyanogen chloride]] were moved to [[Luzon]] from stockpiles in Australia and New Guinea in preparation for Operation Olympic, and MacArthur ensured that [[Chemical Warfare Service]] units were trained in their use.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|p=112}} Consideration was also given to using [[biological weapons]] against Japan.{{sfn|Schaffer|1985|pp=164–165}}

===Air raids on Japan===
{{Main|Air raids on Japan}}
[[File:Boeing B-29A-45-BN Superfortress 44-61784 6 BG 24 BS - Incendiary Journey.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of a four engined World War II-era aircraft being viewed from above while it is flying over a city. A large cloud of smoke is visible immediately below the aircraft.|A B-29 over Osaka on June 1, 1945]]
While the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] became ready for use in combat.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=4}} [[Operation Matterhorn]] involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around [[Chengdu]] in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=22–24}} This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=169–175}}

[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Haywood S. Hansell]] determined that [[Guam]], [[Tinian]], and [[Saipan]] in the [[Mariana Islands]] would better serve as B-29 bases, but they were in Japanese hands.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=29–31}} Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war,{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=507–509}} and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|islands were captured]] between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed,{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=514–521}} and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=548–551}} These bases were easily resupplied by cargo ships.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=536–545}} The [[XXI Bomber Command]] began missions against Japan on November 18, 1944.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=558–560}} The early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued the practice of conducting so-called high-altitude [[precision bombing]], aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=566}} These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.{{sfn|Sandler|2001|pp=24–26}}{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=574–576}}

Hansell's successor, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Curtis LeMay]], assumed command in January 1945 and initially continued to use the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=608–610}} Under pressure from [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) headquarters in Washington, LeMay changed tactics and decided that low-level [[Firebombing|incendiary raids]] against Japanese cities were the only way to destroy their production capabilities, shifting from precision bombing to [[area bombardment]] with incendiaries.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=568–570}} Like most [[strategic bombing during World War II]], the aim of the air offensive against Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and [[demoralization (warfare)|undermine civilian morale]].{{sfn|Edwards|1996|p=83}}{{sfn|Werrell|1996|p=250}}

Over the next six months, the XXI Bomber Command under LeMay firebombed 67 Japanese cities. The [[Bombing of Tokyo|firebombing of Tokyo]], codenamed ''Operation Meetinghouse'', on March 9–10 killed an estimated 100,000 people and destroyed {{convert|16|sqmi}} of the city and 267,000 buildings in a single night. It was the deadliest bombing raid of the war, at a cost of 20 B-29s shot down by flak and fighters.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=614–617}} By May, 75 percent of bombs dropped were incendiaries designed to burn down Japan's "paper cities". By mid-June, Japan's six largest cities had been devastated.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=642–643}} The end of the [[fighting on Okinawa]] that month provided airfields even closer to the Japanese mainland, allowing the bombing campaign to be further escalated. Aircraft flying from Allied [[aircraft carrier]]s and the [[Ryukyu Islands]] also regularly struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall.{{sfn|Kerr|1991|p=207}} Firebombing switched to smaller cities, with populations ranging from 60,000 to 350,000. According to [[Yuki Tanaka (historian)|Yuki Tanaka]], the U.S. fire-bombed over a hundred Japanese towns and cities.{{sfn|Tanaka|Young|2009|pp=5, 84–85, 117}} These raids were devastating.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=653–658}}

The Japanese military was unable to stop the Allied attacks and the country's [[civil defense]] preparations proved inadequate. Japanese fighters and anti-aircraft guns had difficulty engaging bombers flying at high altitude.{{sfn|Coox|1994|pp=412–414}} From April 1945, the Japanese interceptors also had to face American fighter escorts based on [[Iwo Jima]] and Okinawa.{{sfn|Coox|1994|p=422}} That month, the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] stopped attempting to intercept the air raids to preserve fighter aircraft to counter the expected invasion.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|p=54}} By mid-1945 the Japanese only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual B-29s conducting reconnaissance sorties over the country, to conserve supplies of fuel.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|pp=58–59}} In July 1945, the Japanese had {{convert|1156000|USbbl|l}} of [[avgas]] stockpiled for the invasion of Japan. About {{convert|604000|USbbl|l}} had been consumed in the home islands area in April, May and June 1945.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=79–80}} While the Japanese military decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, by this time there were too few operational fighters available for this change of tactics to hinder the Allied air raids.{{sfn|Coox|1994|p=429}}

===Atomic bomb development===
[[File:HD.30.507 (10444069294).jpg|thumb|right|[[Leslie Groves]], [[Manhattan Project]] director, with a map of Japan]]
{{Main|Manhattan Project}}
The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]], made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=7}} Fears that a [[German atomic bomb project]] would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the [[Einstein-Szilard letter]]. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=12}} Progress was slow until the arrival of the British [[MAUD Committee]] report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5 to 10 kilograms of isotopically enriched [[uranium-235]] were needed for a bomb instead of tons of natural uranium and a [[neutron moderator]] like [[heavy water]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=40–43, 76–79}}

The 1943 [[Quebec Agreement]] merged the nuclear weapons projects of the United Kingdom and Canada, [[Tube Alloys]] and the [[Montreal Laboratory]], with the [[Manhattan Project]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Quebec Agreement |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/ManhattanProject/Quebec.shtml |date=August 19, 1943 |publisher=atomicarchive.com |access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/chronology.html |title=Canada's Role in the Atomic Bomb Programs of the United States, Britain, France and India|accessdate=December 4, 2007 |last=Edwards |first=Gordon |authorlink =Gordon Edwards |publisher=Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213010316/http://www.ccnr.org/chronology.html| archivedate=December 13, 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref> under the direction of Major General [[Leslie R.

Robert Oppenheimer]] to organize and head the project's [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico, where bomb design work was carried out.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=82–84}} Two types of bombs were eventually developed, both named by [[Robert Serber]]. [[Little Boy]] was a [[gun-type fission weapon]] that used [[uranium-235]], a rare [[isotope]] of uranium separated at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=522}} The other, known as a [[Fat Man]] device, was a more powerful and efficient, but more complicated, [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] that used [[plutonium]] created in [[nuclear reactor]]s at [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=511–516}}

There was a [[Japanese nuclear weapon program]], but it lacked the human, mineral and financial resources of the Manhattan Project, and never made much progress towards developing an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Grunden|1998|pp=50–52}}

The 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom eventually deployed to Tinian. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from [[Project Alberta]],{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=25}} known as the 1st Technical Detachment.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=706}} The 509th Composite Group's [[393d Bombardment Squadron]] was equipped with 15 [[Silverplate]] B-29s. These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] engines, Curtiss Electric [[Reverse thrust|reversible-pitch]] [[propeller]]s, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14–15}}

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of embarkation at [[Seattle]], Washington.

===Choice of targets===
[[File:Atomic bomb 1945 mission map.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mission runs of August 6 and 9, with Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and [[Kokura]] (the original target for August 9) displayed|alt=map of Japan and the Marianas Islands indicating the routes taken by the raids. One goes straight to Iwo Jima and Hiroshima and back the same way. The other goes to the southern tip of Japan, up to Kokura, down to Nagasaki, and the southwest to Okinawa befofore heading back to Tinian.]]
In April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson. Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A. Derry, [[Colonel]] William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and [[David M. Dennison]] from the USAAF; and scientists [[John von Neumann]], [[Robert R. Wilson]] and [[William Penney, Baron Penney|William Penney]] from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on May 10, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on May 28, where it was briefed by Tibbets and [[Commander]] [[Frederick Ashworth]] from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, [[Richard C. Tolman]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=528–529}}

The Target Committee nominated five targets: [[Kokura]] (now [[Kitakyushu]]), the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; [[Hiroshima]], an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; [[Yokohama]], an urban center for aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries; [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and [[Kyoto]], a major industrial center. The target selection was subject to the following criteria:
* The target was larger than {{convert|3|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and was an important target in a large city.
* The blast would create effective damage.
* The target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945.<ref name="targetcommittee" />

These cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids, and the Army Air Forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the damage caused by the atomic bombs could be made. Hiroshima was described as "an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good [[Incendiary device|incendiary]] target."<ref name="targetcommittee" />

The Target Committee stated that "It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance. Two aspects of this are (1) obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan and (2) making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released. ... Kyoto has the advantage of the people being more highly intelligent and hence better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon. Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size and with possible focussing from nearby mountains that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed. The [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Emperor's palace]] in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value."<ref name="targetcommittee">{{cite web| title=Atomic Bomb: Decision – Target Committee, May 10–11, 1945 |url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html | accessdate=August 6, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050808014201/http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html |archivedate=August 8, 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Edwin O. Reischauer]], a Japan expert for the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Intelligence Service]], was incorrectly said to have prevented the bombing of Kyoto.<ref name="targetcommittee" /> In his autobiography, Reischauer specifically refuted this claim:

{{quote|...&nbsp;the only person deserving credit for saving Kyoto from destruction is Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier.{{sfn|Reischauer|1986|p=101}}{{sfn|Kelly|2012|pp=183–203}} }}
On May 30, Stimson asked Groves to remove Kyoto from the target list due to its historical, religious and cultural significance, but Groves pointed to its military and industrial significance.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=529}} Stimson then approached [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] about the matter. Truman agreed with Stimson, and Kyoto was temporarily removed from the target list.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=67–68}} Groves attempted to restore Kyoto to the target list in July, but Stimson remained adamant.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=149–150}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=530}} On July 25, [[Nagasaki]] was put on the target list in place of Kyoto. It was a major military port, one of Japan's largest shipbuilding and repair centers, and an important producer of naval ordnance.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=530}}

===Proposed demonstration===
In early May 1945, the [[Interim Committee]] was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to [[Nuclear technology|nuclear energy]].{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=255–256}} During the meetings on May 31 and June 1, scientist [[Ernest Lawrence]] had suggested giving the Japanese a non-combat demonstration.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=240}} [[Arthur Compton]] later recalled that:

{{quote|It was evident that everyone would suspect trickery. If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=238–239}} }}

The possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the [[Franck Report]] issued by physicist [[James Franck]] on June 11 and the Scientific Advisory Panel rejected his report on June 16, saying that "we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use." Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military target.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=255–260}}

Like Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied [[prisoners of war]] might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, although more bombs were in production, only two would be available at the start of August, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.{{sfn|Newman|1995|p=86}}<ref name="Generals">{{cite web |title=The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources| work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 | publisher=[[George Washington University]]| date=August 13, 1945|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}</ref>

===Leaflets===
[[File:Firebombing leaflet.jpg|thumb|left|Various leaflets were dropped on Japan, three versions showing the names of 11 or 12 Japanese cities targeted for destruction by firebombing.

For several months, the U.S. had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63&nbsp;million leaflets across Japan. Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97 percent destroyed. LeMay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact of bombing, and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing cities. Even with the warnings, [[Japanese dissidence during the early Shōwa period#Japanese resistance during World War II|Japanese opposition to the war]] remained ineffective. In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful, with many Japanese choosing to leave major cities. The leaflets caused such concern that the government ordered the arrest of anyone caught in possession of a leaflet.<ref name="The Information War in the Pacific" />{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=656}} Leaflet texts were prepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice "to appeal to their compatriots".{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=153}}

In preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer-led [[Interim Committee|Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee]] decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet warning. Those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation and also because of the wish to maximize [[Psychological warfare|shock in the leadership]].{{sfn|McNelly|2000|p=138}} No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped.{{sfn|Lifton|1991|p=17}} Various sources gave conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb. [[Robert Jay Lifton]] wrote that it was July 27,{{sfn|Lifton|1991|p=17}} and Theodore H. McNelly wrote that it was July 30.{{sfn|McNelly|2000|p=138}} The USAAF history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27, but Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on July 30.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|p=656}} Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4. Hiroshima may have been leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was dropped.{{sfn|Lifton|1991|p=17}} Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities targeted for firebombing; a total of 33 cities listed. With the text of this leaflet reading in Japanese "...we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked..."<ref name="The Information War in the Pacific" /> Hiroshima was not listed.<ref>{{cite web | script-title=ja:空襲予告ビラ、高山市民が保管 市内で展示 |trans-title=Air Raid Notice |url=http://www.gifu-np.co.jp/kikaku/2008/gifu63/g63_20080804.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012064011/http://www.gifu-np.co.jp/kikaku/2008/gifu63/g63_20080804.shtml |archive-date=October 12, 2013 | publisher=岐阜新聞社 (Gifu Shinbunsha (Open Library)) |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |language=Japanese}}</ref>{{sfn|Bungei|1981|p=215}}

===Consultation with Britain and Canada===
[[File:Letter received from General Thomas Handy to General Carl Spaatz authorizing the dropping of the first atomic bomb - NARA - 542193.tif|thumb|upright|General [[Thomas Handy]]'s order to General [[Carl Spaatz]] ordering the dropping of the atomic bombs]]
In 1943, The United States and the United Kingdom signed the [[Quebec Agreement]], which stipulated that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. Stimson therefore had to obtain British permission. A meeting of the [[Combined Policy Committee]], which included one Canadian representative, was held at [[the Pentagon]] on July 4, 1945.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372–373}} [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|Henry Maitland Wilson]] announced that the British government concurred with the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372–373}}{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945Berlinv01/d619 |title=Minutes of a Meeting of the Combined Policy Committee |location=Washington, DC |date=July 4, 1945 |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=18 September 2017 }}</ref> As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to [[Joseph Stalin]], the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], at the upcoming [[Potsdam Conference]], as this also required British concurrence.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372–373}}

Orders for the attack were issued to General [[Carl Spaatz]] on July 25 under the signature of General [[Thomas T. Handy]], the acting Chief of Staff, since Marshall was at the Potsdam Conference with Truman.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=712–713}} It read:

{{quote|
# The 509th Composite Group, 20th Air Force will deliver its first special bomb as soon as weather will permit visual bombing after about 3 August 1945 on one of the targets: Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata and Nagasaki. To carry military and civilian scientific personnel from the War Department to observe and record the effects of the explosion of the bomb, additional aircraft will accompany the airplane carrying the bomb. The observing planes will stay several miles distant from the point of impact of the bomb.
# Additional bombs will be delivered on the above targets as soon as made ready by the project staff. Further instructions will be issued concerning targets other than those listed above.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/542193 |title=Letter received from General Thomas Handy to General Carl Spaatz authorizing the dropping of the first atomic bomb |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |access-date=January 26, 2018 |date=July 25, 1945 |series=Series: Black and White Photographs of U.S. Air Force and Predecessors' Activities, Facilities, and Personnel, Domestic and Foreign, 1900–2003 }}</ref> }}

That day, Truman noted in his diary that:

{{quote|This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August&nbsp;10th. I have told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital [Kyoto] or the new [Tokyo]. He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/hst-jl25.html |accessdate=August 1, 2020 |title=Harry S.

===Potsdam Declaration===
{{Main|Potsdam Declaration}}
The July 16 success of the [[Trinity Test]] in the [[New Mexico]] desert exceeded expectations.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=389–390}} On July 26, Allied leaders issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]], which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration was presented as an [[ultimatum]] and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in "the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland". The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqué.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=395–396}}

On July 28, Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Suzuki Kantarō]] declared at a press conference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash (''yakinaoshi'') of the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] and that the government intended to ignore it (''[[mokusatsu]]'', "kill by silence").<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|1999|pp=233–234}}. The meaning of ''mokusatsu'' can fall anywhere in the range of "ignore" to "treat with contempt".</ref> The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position.{{sfn|Bix|1996|p=290}} Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the ''[[kokutai]]'' (Imperial institution and national [[polity]]), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], Korea or [[Formosa]], and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.{{sfn|Asada|1996|p=39}}

At Potsdam, Truman agreed to a request from [[Winston Churchill]] that Britain be represented when the atomic bomb was dropped. [[William Penney]] and [[Group Captain]] [[Leonard Cheshire]] were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal to Wilson.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=326, 356, 370}}

===Bombs===
The Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=262}} There were two uranium-235 components, a hollow cylindrical projectile and a cylindrical target insert. The projectile was completed on June 15, and the target insert on July 24.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=265}} The projectile and eight bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the powder charge and fissile components) left [[Hunters Point Naval Shipyard]], California, on July 16 aboard the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}, and arrived on Tinian on July 26.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=30}} The target insert followed by air on July 30, accompanied by Commander [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|Francis Birch]] from Project Alberta.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=265}} Responding to concerns expressed by the 509th Composite Group about the possibility of a B-29 crashing on takeoff, Birch had modified the Little Boy design to incorporate a removable breech plug that would permit the bomb to be armed in flight.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=262}}

The first [[plutonium core]], along with its [[polonium]]-[[beryllium]] [[urchin (detonator)|urchin initiator]], was transported in the custody of Project Alberta courier [[Raemer Schreiber]] in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by [[Philip Morrison]]. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a [[neutron reflector|tamper]].{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=45}} The core departed from [[Kirtland Air Force Base|Kirtland Army Air Field]] on a [[C-54]] transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's [[320th Troop Carrier Squadron]] on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=38–40}}

At the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of industrial and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]]'s [[Second General Army (Japan)|Second General Army]], which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan,{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=64–65, 163}} and was located in [[Hiroshima Castle]]. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1995|p=41}} Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the [[Fifty-Ninth Army (Japan)|59th Army]], the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Division]] and the [[224th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|224th Division]], a recently formed mobile unit.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=70, 163}} The city was defended by five batteries of 70 mm and 80 mm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city.{{sfn|Zaloga|Noon|2010|p=59}}

Hiroshima was a supply and logistics base for the Japanese military.<ref name="effects">{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/redocuments/1946/460619-bombing-survey1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011111052/http://www.nuclearfiles.org/redocuments/1946/460619-bombing-survey1.html |archivedate=October 11, 2004 |title=U.

Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=38}} It was the second largest city in Japan after Kyoto that was still undamaged by air raids,{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=316}} primarily because it lacked the aircraft manufacturing industry that was the XXI Bomber Command's priority target. On July 3, the Joint Chiefs of Staff placed it off limits to bombers, along with Kokura, Niigata and Kyoto.{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=263}}

The population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a [[Evacuations of civilians in Japan during World War II|systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government]].

===Bombing of Hiroshima===
Hiroshima was the primary target of the first atomic bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. The 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 ''[[Enola Gay]]'', named after Tibbets's mother and piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, [[Tinian]], about six hours' flight time from Japan. ''Enola Gay'' was accompanied by two other B-29s: ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', commanded by Major [[Charles Sweeney]], which carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, which served as the photography aircraft.<ref name="509timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/CG/CG_09C.htm| title=509th Timeline: Inception to Hiroshima| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=Role of weather group of airplanes is not mentioned in body.

During the night of August 5–6, Japanese early warning radar detected the approach of numerous American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan. Radar detected 65 bombers headed for Saga, 102 bound for [[Maebashi]], 261 en route to [[Nishinomiya]], 111 headed for [[Ube, Yamaguchi|Ube]] and 66 bound for Imabari. An alert was given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima. The all-clear was sounded in Hiroshima at 00:05.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=391–392}} About an hour before the bombing, the air raid alert was sounded again, as ''Straight Flush'' flew over the city. It broadcast a short message which was picked up by ''Enola Gay''. It read: "Cloud cover less than 3/10th at all altitudes. Advice: bomb primary."{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=414}} The all-clear was sounded over Hiroshima again at 07:09.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|p=415}}

The strike report said {{convert|30,200|ft}}, the official history said {{convert|31,600|ft}}, Parson's log entry was {{convert|32,700|ft}}, and the navigator's log was {{convert|31,060|ft}}—the latter possibly an error transposing two digits. A later calculation using the indicated atmospheric pressure arrived at the figure of {{convert|32,200|ft}}. Similarly, several values have been reported as the altitude of the Little Boy bomb at the moment of detonation.

''Enola Gay'' stayed over the target area for two minutes and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated. Only Tibbets, Parsons, and Ferebee knew of the nature of the weapon; the others on the bomber were only told to expect a blinding flash and given black goggles. "It was hard to believe what we saw", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said "the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'".

Some of the reinforced concrete buildings in Hiroshima had been very strongly constructed because of the earthquake danger in Japan, and their framework did not collapse even though they were fairly close to the blast center. Since the bomb detonated in the air, the blast was directed more downward than sideways, which was largely responsible for the survival of the ''[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial|Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall]]'', now commonly known as the ''Genbaku'' (A-bomb) dome. This building was designed and built by the Czech architect [[Jan Letzel]], and was only {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} from [[ground zero]] (the [[hypocenter]])<!--Hypocenter (as in "Nagasaki Hypocenter Monument") means below-center and is appropriate, being at ground level.

The ruin was named ''Hiroshima Peace Memorial'' and was made a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996 over the objections of the United States and China, which expressed reservations on the grounds that other Asian nations were the ones who suffered the greatest loss of life and property, and a focus on Japan lacked historical perspective.<ref>{{cite web| title=Statements by China and the United States of America during the Inscription of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/repco96x.htm#annex5 | accessdate=August 6, 2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829222745/https://whc.unesco.org/archive/repco96x.htm| archivedate=August 29, 2005 | url-status=live}}</ref> The bombing started intense fires that spread rapidly through timber and paper homes, burning everything in a radius of {{convert|2|km|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation|2003|p=20}} As in other Japanese cities, the firebreaks proved ineffective.{{sfn|Ham|2011|p=330}}

Military bases repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima.

A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff.

After the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon. He stated, "We may be grateful to Providence" that [[German nuclear weapon project|the German atomic bomb project]] had failed, and that the United States and its allies had "spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history—and won". Truman then warned Japan: "If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.

Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] had informed Tokyo of the Soviet Union's unilateral abrogation of the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] on April 5.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|p=46}} At two minutes past midnight on August 9, [[Japan Standard Time|Tokyo time]], Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]].{{sfn|Slavinskiĭ|2004|pp=153–154}} Four hours later, word reached Tokyo of the Soviet Union's official declaration of war. The senior leadership of the Japanese Army began preparations to impose [[martial law]] on the nation, with the support of Minister of War [[Korechika Anami]], to stop anyone attempting to make peace.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=288–289}}

On August 7, a day after Hiroshima was destroyed, Dr. [[Yoshio Nishina]] and other atomic physicists arrived at the city, and carefully examined the damage. They then went back to Tokyo and told the cabinet that Hiroshima was indeed destroyed by a nuclear weapon. Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]], the Chief of the Naval General Staff, estimated that no more than one or two additional bombs could be readied, so they decided to endure the remaining attacks, acknowledging "there would be more destruction but the war would go on".{{sfn|Hoyt|2001|p=401}} American [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic codebreakers]] intercepted the cabinet's messages.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=283–284}}

Parsons said that [[Project Alberta]] would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=342}}{{sfn|Russ|1990|pp=64–65}}

The city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]], ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were [[Mitsubishi]] Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90 percent of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90 percent of the city's industry.<ref name="Nagasaki" /> Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with [[AN/APQ-13]] radar.{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=263}}

Unlike the other target cities, Nagasaki had not been placed off limits to bombers by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's July 3 directive,{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=263}}{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=309}} and was bombed on a small scale five times. During one of these raids on August 1, a number of conventional high-explosive bombs were dropped on the city. A few hit the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city, and several hit the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works.<ref name="Nagasaki">{{cite web |publisher=Harry S.

In contrast to Hiroshima, almost all of the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=353–354}}

===Bombing of Nagasaki===
Responsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets. Scheduled for August 11 against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on August 10.{{sfn|Sherwin|2003|pp=233–234}} Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using ''[[Bockscar]]''<!-- yes, it is "Bockscar" not "Bock's Car". This is ''not'' a typo! --> as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=114}}

At 03:47 Tinian time (GMT+10), 02:47 Japanese time <ref name="SM19">{{cite web |url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/hiroshima-and-nagasaki-bombing-timeline| title=Hiroshima and Nagasaki Bombing Timeline| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=9 August 2020}}</ref> on the morning of August 9, 1945, ''Bockscar''<!-- yes, it is "Bockscar" not "Bock's Car". This is ''not'' a typo! -->, flown by Sweeney's crew, lifted off from [[Tinian]] island with Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.<ref name="SM16">{{cite web |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07m1.htm| title=Timeline #3- the 509th; The Nagasaki Mission| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref>

During pre-flight inspection of ''Bockscar'', the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use {{convert|640|USgal}} of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have ''Bockscar'' continue the mission.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=204–205}}<ref name="The Story of Nagasaki">{{cite web |url=http://www.hiroshima-remembered.com/history/nagasaki/page3.html |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |title=The Story of Nagasaki}}</ref>

This time Penney and Cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission, flying as observers on the third plane, ''[[Big Stink (B-29)|Big Stink]]'', flown by the group's operations officer, Major James I. Hopkins, Jr. Observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear. When Sweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of Japan, ''Big Stink'' failed to make the rendezvous.<ref name="SM16" /> According to Cheshire, Hopkins was at varying heights including {{convert|9000|ft}} higher than he should have been, and was not flying tight circles over [[Yakushima]] as previously agreed with Sweeney and Captain [[Frederick C. Bock]], who was piloting the support B-29 ''The Great Artiste''. Instead, Hopkins was flying {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} dogleg patterns.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|p=212}} Though ordered not to circle longer than fifteen minutes, Sweeney continued to wait for ''Big Stink'' for forty minutes. Before leaving the rendezvous point, Sweeney consulted Ashworth, who was in charge of the bomb. As commander of the aircraft, Sweeney made the decision to proceed to the primary, the city of Kokura.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|p=211}}

After exceeding the original departure time limit by nearly a half-hour, ''Bockscar'', accompanied by ''The Great Artiste'', proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby [[Yahata, Fukuoka|Yahata]] the previous day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mic.com/articles/95204/the-untold-story-of-how-japanese-steel-workers-saved-their-city-from-the-atomic-bomb|title=The Untold Story of How Japanese Steel Workers Saved Their City From the Atomic Bomb|first=Sophie|last=Kleeman|website=Mic}}</ref> Additionally, the Yahata Steel Works intentionally burned [[coal tar]], to produce black smoke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20140726p2a00m0na014000c.html| title=Steel mill worker reveals blocking view of U.S. aircraft on day of Nagasaki atomic bombing| work=Mainichi Weekly| date=November 23, 2015| accessdate=January 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122171430/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/features/news/20140726p2a00m0na014000c.html|archivedate=2015-11-22}}</ref> The clouds and smoke resulted in 70 percent of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses around Kokura, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant [[Jacob Beser]], who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=213–215}}

With fuel running low because of the failed fuel pump, ''Bockscar'' and ''The Great Artiste'' headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki.<ref name="SM16" /> Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that ''Bockscar'' had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and would be forced to divert to [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory [[Battle of Okinawa#Southern Okinawa|only six weeks earlier]]. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth agreed with Sweeney's suggestion that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.<ref name="Spitzer">{{cite web|url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/COLLECTIONS/CG-ASPI/01/Pages/CGP-ASPI-025.htm| title=Spitzer Personal Diary Page 25 (CGP-ASPI-025)| publisher=The Atomic Heritage Foundation| accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref>{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=216–217}} At about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but the "all clear" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses were sighted at 10:53 Japanese Time (GMT+9), the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.{{sfn|Chun|2008|p=70}}

A few minutes later at 11:00 Japanese Time, ''The Great Artiste'' dropped instruments attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the [[University of Tokyo]] who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=295}} In 1949, one of the authors of the letter, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], met with Sagane and signed the letter.<ref name="Stories from Riken">{{cite web|url=http://www.riken.jp/r-world/info/release/riken88/text/image/pdf/no09e.pdf| title=Stories from Riken | accessdate=April 30, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610165712/http://www.riken.jp/r-world/info/release/riken88/text/image/pdf/no09e.pdf |archive-date=June 10, 2012 |publisher=[[Riken]] }}</ref>

At 11:01 Japanese Time, a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed ''Bockscar''{{-'}}s bombardier, Captain [[Kermit Beahan]], to visually sight the target as ordered. The Fat Man weapon, containing a core of about {{convert|5|kg|abbr=on}} of [[plutonium]], was dropped over the city's industrial valley. It exploded 47 seconds later at 11:02 Japanese Time<ref name="SM19" /> at {{convert|1650|±|33|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, above a tennis court,{{sfn|Kerr et al|2005|pp=43, 46}} halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Nagasaki Arsenal in the north. This was nearly {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the [[Urakami|Urakami Valley]] and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills.{{sfn|Wainstock|1996|p=92}} The resulting explosion released the equivalent energy of {{convert|21|±|2|ktonTNT|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Kerr et al|2005|pp=42–43}} ''Big Stink'' spotted the explosion from a hundred miles away, and flew over to observe.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=346}}

[[File:UrakamiTenshudoJan1946.jpg|thumb|right|[[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Nagasaki|Urakami Tenshudo (Catholic Church in Nagasaki)]] destroyed by the bomb, the dome/bell of the church, at right, having toppled off]]
''Bockscar'' flew on to Okinawa, arriving with only sufficient fuel for a single approach. Sweeney tried repeatedly to contact the control tower for landing clearance, but received no answer. He could see heavy air traffic landing and taking off from [[Yontan Airfield]]. Firing off every flare on board to alert the field to his emergency landing, the ''Bockscar'' came in fast, landing at {{convert|140|mph}} instead of the normal {{convert|120|mph}}. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as he began the final approach. Touching down on only three engines midway down the landing strip, ''Bockscar'' bounced up into the air again for about {{convert|25|feet}} before slamming back down hard. The heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. Its reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, ''Bockscar'' made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off it. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion before the plane came to a stop.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=222–226}}

Following the mission, there was confusion over the identification of the plane. The first eyewitness account by war correspondent [[William L. Laurence]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who accompanied the mission aboard the aircraft piloted by Bock, reported that Sweeney was leading the mission in ''The Great Artiste''. He also noted its "Victor" number as 77, which was that of ''Bockscar''.<ref name="Eyewitness">{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/Nagasaki.shtml |last=Laurence |first=William L.|authorlink=William Laurence |title=Eyewitness Account of Atomic Bomb Over Nagasaki |publisher=Atomic Archive |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref> Laurence had interviewed Sweeney and his crew, and was aware that they referred to their airplane as ''The Great Artiste''. Except for ''Enola Gay'', none of the 393d's B-29s had yet had names painted on the noses, a fact which Laurence himself noted in his account. Unaware of the switch in aircraft, Laurence assumed Victor 77 was ''The Great Artiste'',{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=222}} which was in fact, Victor 89.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=184}}

Groves expected to have another "Fat Man" atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with three more in September and a further three in October;<ref name="Generals" /> a second Little Boy bomb (using U-235) would not be available until December 1945.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=175, 203, 224}}{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=689}} On August 10, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that "the next bomb&nbsp;... should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August." Marshall endorsed the memo with the hand-written comment, "It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President",<ref name="Generals" /> something Truman had requested that day. This modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs "as made ready".{{sfn|Bernstein|1991|pp=149–173}} There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for [[Operation Downfall]], and Marshall suggested to Stimson that the remaining cities on the target list be spared attack with atomic bombs.{{sfn|Giangreco|2009|pp=111–112}}

Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave [[Kirtland Field]] for Tinian on August 11 and 14,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=396–397}} and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay to return to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], to collect them.<ref name="PaulTibbets StudsTerkel">{{cite web|url=http://www.avweb.com/news/profiles/PaulTibbets_StudsTerkel_EnolaGayInterview_2002_196499-1.html| title=Paul Tibbets Interview| last=Terkel| first=Studs | authorlink=Studs Terkel| publisher=Aviation Publishing Group| date=November 1, 2007| accessdate=January 2, 2012 }}</ref> At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast [[Demon core|another plutonium core]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/lawrence-litzs-interview-2012 |title=Lawrence Litz's Interview (2012) |publisher=Voices of the Manhattan Project |accessdate=February 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301064230/https://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/lawrence-litzs-interview-2012 |archive-date=March 1, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/08/16/the-third-cores-revenge/ |title=The Third Core's Revenge |website=nuclearsecrecy.com |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 27, 2015 }}</ref> Therefore, it could have been ready for use on August 19.

==Surrender of Japan and subsequent occupation==
{{Main|Surrender of Japan|Occupation of Japan}}
Until August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender. The full cabinet met on 14:30 on August 9, and spent most of the day debating surrender. Anami conceded that victory was unlikely, but argued in favour of continuing the war nonetheless. The meeting ended at 17:30, with no decision having been reached. Suzuki went to the palace to report on the outcome of meeting, where he met with [[Kōichi Kido]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan]]. Kido informed him that the emperor had agreed to hold an imperial conference, and gave a strong indication that the emperor would consent to surrender on condition that ''[[kokutai]]'' be preserved. A second cabinet meeting was held at 18:00. Only four ministers supported Anami's position of adhering to the four conditions, but since cabinet decisions had to be unanimous, no decision was reached before it ended at 22:00.{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=207–208}}

Calling an imperial conference required the signatures of the prime minister and the two service chiefs, but the [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] [[Hisatsune Sakomizu]] had already obtained signatures from Toyoda and General [[Yoshijirō Umezu]] in advance, and he reneged on his promise to inform them if a meeting was to be held. The meeting commenced at 23:50. No consensus had emerged by 02:00 on August 10, but the emperor gave his "sacred decision",{{sfn|Hasegawa|2006|pp=209–210}} authorizing the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Minister]], [[Shigenori Tōgō]], to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on one condition, that the declaration "does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler."{{sfn|Kido|Yoshitake|1966|p=1223}}

On August 12, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka|Prince Asaka]], then asked whether the war would be continued if the ''kokutai'' could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied, "Of course."{{sfn|Fujiwara|1991|p=129}} As the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne, Hirohito recorded on August 14 his [[Gyokuon-hōsō|capitulation announcement]] which was broadcast to the Japanese nation the next day despite a [[Kyūjō Incident|short rebellion]] by militarists opposed to the surrender.{{sfn|Frank|1999|pp=316–319}}

In his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings and did not explicitly mention the Soviets as a factor for surrender:

{{quote|Despite the best that has been done by every one—the gallant fighting of military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of Our servants of the State and the devoted service of Our one hundred million people, the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest. Moreover, the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.

Such being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/yosha/yr/empires/Imperial_rescript_1945-08-14.html |title=Imperial Rescript ending war – What Hirohito really said in his acceptance speech |translator=William Wetherall |access-date=September 15, 2013 |publisher=Yosha Research |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130915082323/http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/yosha/yr/empires/Imperial_rescript_1945-08-14.html |archive-date=September 15, 2013 }}</ref> }}

In his "Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors" delivered on August 17, however, he stressed the impact of the Soviet invasion on his decision to surrender.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwandocuments.org/surrender07.htm |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |publisher=Taiwan Document Project |title=Emperor Hirohito's Surrender Rescript to Japanese Troops |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212180054/http://www.taiwandocuments.org/surrender07.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2012 }}</ref>

The bombing amazed [[Otto Hahn]] and other German atomic scientists, whom the British held at Farm Hall in [[Operation Epsilon]].

[[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] said "I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I think it is madness on their part", but Heisenberg replied, "One could equally well say 'That's the quickest way of ending the war'".

===Investigations into brain development===
{{See also|Radiation-induced cognitive decline#Radiation Therapy}}

Despite the small sample size of 1,600 to 1,800 persons who came forth as [[prenatal]]ly exposed at the time of the bombings, that were both within a close proximity to the two hypocenters, to survive the ''[[in utero]]'' absorption of a substantial dose of radiation and then the [[malnourished]] post-attack environment, data from this cohort does support the increased risk of [[severe mental retardation]] (SMR), that was observed in some 30 individuals, with SMR being a common outcome of the aforementioned microencephaly. While a lack of statistical data, with just 30 individuals out of 1,800, prevents a definitive determination of a [[Threshold model#Toxicology|threshold point]], the data collected suggests a threshold intrauterine or ''fetal'' dose for SMR, at the most radiosensitive period of cognitive development, when there is the largest number of [[undifferentiated cell|undifferentiated]] neural cells (8 to 15 weeks post-conception) [[Dose–response relationship|to begin at a threshold dose]] of approximately "0.09" to "0.15" [[Gray (unit)|Gy]], with the risk then linearly increasing to a 43-percent rate of SMR when exposed to a fetal dose of 1 Gy at any point during these weeks of rapid [[neurogenesis]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/1224/chapter/8|title=Read "Health Effects of Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR V" at NAP.edu|via=nap.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1088/0952-4746/12/2/005|title = ICRP and impairment of mental function following prenatal irradiation| journal=Journal of Radiological Protection| volume=12| issue=2| pages=93–105|year = 1992|last1 = Mole|first1 = R.

However either side of this radiosensitive age, none of the prenatally exposed to the bombings at an age ''less than'' 8 weeks, that is prior to [[synaptogenesis]] or at a gestational age ''more than'' 26 weeks "were observed to be mentally retarded", with the condition therefore being isolated to those solely of 8–26 weeks of age and who absorbed more than approximately "0.09" to "0.15" Gy of ''prompt'' radiation energy.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1741-4520.1989.tb00751.x|title = Prenatal Exposure to Atomic Radiation and Brain Damage| journal=Congenital Anomalies| volume=29| issue=4| pages=309–320|year = 1989|last1 = Otake|first1 = Masanori| last2=Yoshimaru| first2=Hiroshi| last3=Schull| first3=William J.}}</ref>

Many other investigations into cognitive outcomes, such as [[schizophrenia]] as a result of prenatal exposure, have been conducted with "no statistically significant linear relationship seen", there is a suggestion that in the most extremely exposed, those who survived within a kilometer or so of the hypocenters, a trend emerges akin to that seen in SMR, though the sample size is too small to determine with any significance.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1999.tb10877.x|pmid = 10563451|title = Lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia among individuals prenatally exposed to atomic bomb radiation in Nagasaki City| journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica| volume=100| issue=5| pages=344–349|year = 2007|last1 = Imamura|first1 = Y.| last2=Nakane| first2=Y.| last3=Ohta| first3=Y.| last4=Kondo| first4=H.}}</ref>

===Nagasaki===
Nagasaki was also rebuilt after the war, but was dramatically changed in the process. The pace of reconstruction was initially slow, and the first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946. The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade, shipbuilding and fishing. This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949.<ref name="After the Bomb">{{cite web|url=http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_ruins.shtml |title=After the Bomb|publisher=Atomic Bomb Museum |access-date=February 22, 2017 }}</ref> New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity.

==Debate over bombings==
{{Main|Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
The role of the bombings in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]], and the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the United States' justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate.{{sfn|Walker|2005|p=334}} On one hand, it has been argued that the bombings caused the Japanese surrender, thereby preventing casualties that an invasion of Japan would have involved.{{sfn|Brooks|Stanley|2007|pp=41–44}}{{sfn|Jowett|Andrew|2002|pp=23–24}} Stimson talked of saving one million casualties.{{sfn|Selden|Selden|1990|pp=xxx–xxxi}} The naval blockade might have starved the Japanese into submission without an invasion, but this would also have resulted in many more Japanese deaths.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=97–114}}

Japanese historian [[Tsuyoshi Hasegawa]] argued that the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan "played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could terminate the war through Moscow's mediation".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.foxnews.com/world/historians-soviet-offensive-key-to-japans-wwii-surrender-was-eclipsed-by-a-bombs |accessdate=September 18, 2013 |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |agency=Associated Press |title=Historians: Soviet offensive, key to Japan's WWII surrender, was eclipsed by A-bombs |date=August 14, 2010}}</ref> A view among critics of the bombings, that was popularized by American historian [[Gar Alperovitz]] in 1965, is the idea of atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons to intimidate the Soviet Union in the early stages of the [[Cold War]]. Although not accepted by mainstream historians, this became the position in Japanese school history textbooks.{{sfn|Orr|2008|pp=521–529}}

Those who oppose the bombings give other reasons for their view, among them: a belief that atomic bombing is fundamentally immoral,  that the bombings counted as [[war crime]]s, and that they constituted state terrorism.{{sfn|Stohl|1979|p=279}}

==Legacy==
{{Main|Nuclear warfare}}
Like the way it began, the manner in which World War II ended cast a long shadow over international relations for decades to come. By June 30, 1946, there were components for nine atomic bombs in the US arsenal, all Fat Man devices identical to the one used in the bombing of Nagasaki.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|pp=266–267}} The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=212–213}} The [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] had decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting "an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/bombing-hiroshima-nagasaki-ethical-standard-common-the-barbarians-the-dark-ages-1444069 |newspaper=The Daily Star |title=Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki" "An ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages" |date=August 6, 2017 |access-date=February 23, 2018 |first=Shahedul Anam |last=Khan }}</ref> but in October 1947, he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=267}}

The American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted four years before the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb in September 1949.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=267}} The United States responded with the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], a nuclear weapon a thousand times as powerful as the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=291}} Such ordinary fission bombs would henceforth be regarded as small [[tactical nuclear weapons]]. By 1986, the United States had 23,317 nuclear weapons, while the [[Soviet Union]] had 40,159. In early 2019, more than 90% of the world's 13,865 nuclear weapons were owned by [[Russia]] and the United States.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kelsey |last=Reichmann |title=Here's how many nuclear warheads exist, and which countries own them |url=https://www.defensenews.com/global/2019/06/16/heres-how-many-nuclear-warheads-exist-and-which-countries-own-them/ |newspaper=Defense News |date=June 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Global Nuclear Arsenal Declines, But Future Cuts Uncertain Amid U.S.-Russia Tensions |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/nuclear-weapons-russia-start-inf-warheads/30003088.html |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) |date=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702194556/https://www.rferl.org/a/nuclear-weapons-russia-start-inf-warheads/30003088.html |archive-date=July 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 2020, [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine nations had nuclear weapons]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Nuclear weapons: Which countries have them and how many are there? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-51091897 |publisher=BBC News |date=January 14, 2020}}</ref> but Japan was not one of them.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|p=269}} Japan reluctantly signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] in February 1970,{{sfn|Quester|1970|p=765}} but it is still sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella. American nuclear weapons were stored on Okinawa, and sometimes in Japan itself, albeit in contravention of agreements between the two nations.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|pp=80–82}} Lacking the resources to fight the Soviet Union using conventional forces, the [[Western Alliance]] came to depend on the use of nuclear weapons to defend itself during the [[Cold War]], a policy that became known in the 1950s as the [[New Look (policy)|New Look]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|p=272}} In the decades after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States would threaten to use its nuclear weapons many times.{{sfn|Ellsberg|2017|pp=319–322}} 

On July 7, 2017, more than 120 countries voted to adopt the UN [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]]. Elayne Whyte Gómez, President of the UN negotiations on the nuclear ban treaty, said "the world has been waiting for this legal norm for 70 years," since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.<ref>{{cite news |title=122 countries adopt 'historic' UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-treaty-ban-nuclear-weapons-1.4192761 |publisher=CBC News |date=July 7, 2017}}</ref> {{Asof|2020}}, Japan has not signed the treaty.<ref>{{cite news |title=Editorial: It's time for Japan to step up and join nuclear ban treaty |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13522651 |newspaper=The Asahi Shimbun |date=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Nagasaki marks 75th A-bomb anniversary with call for Japan to sign nuke ban as new arms race looms |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/09/national/nagasaki-75th-anniversary-atomic-bombing/ |newspaper=Japan Times |date=August 9, 2020}}</ref>
